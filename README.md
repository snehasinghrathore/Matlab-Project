This project focuses on the development of a MATLAB-based Graphical User Interface (GUI) that provides an interactive and comprehensive platform for studying various analog modulation techniques. The GUI enables users to input essential parameters such as message amplitude, message frequency, carrier amplitude, and carrier frequency to generate the corresponding message signal, carrier signal, and modulated signal. It also computes and displays the modulation index, which serves as a key performance parameter for amplitude and frequency modulation schemes. To facilitate thorough analysis, the system presents the results in both time and frequency domains, allowing users to observe the impact of parameter variations on the waveform as well as its spectral characteristics. The GUI incorporates modulation schemes like Amplitude Modulation (AM), Frequency Modulation (FM), Double-Sideband Suppressed Carrier (DSB-SC), Single-Sideband Suppressed Carrier (SSB-SC), and Vestigial Sideband (VSB). The spectral view is obtained by applying FFT to the modulated signal. By dynamically adjusting parameters such as carrier frequency and modulation index, users can visualize how these factors influence the efficiency and bandwidth of the modulated signal. The interface is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, providing clear graphical outputs of the message, carrier, and modulated signals along with their respective spectra. This GUI serves as an effective educational tool for students learning communication systems, as well as a supportive platform for researchers and engineers exploring the intricacies of modulation.
